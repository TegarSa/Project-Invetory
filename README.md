# Project Inventory
---

Project Inventory is a Java-based application that allows users to manage and organize inventory data efficiently.  
This project was developed for learning and testing purposes, focusing on fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

---
## Key Features
- Add, edit, and delete inventory items  
- Display a complete list of stored items  
- Search for items by name or code  
- Store data using either **local file storage** or a MySQL database 
- Simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with JFrame

---
## Technologies Used
- Java SE 
- OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) 
- Collections Framework  
- Swing (JFrame GUI)  
- MySQL (optional for persistence)

---
## Project Description
This project simulates a small-scale inventory management system that demonstrates the use of:
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in class design  
- CRUD operations with basic data validation  
- Integration of a GUI interface for interactive user experience  
- Connection to MySQL for persistent data storage (optional)

It serves as a practice and testing environment for beginners to understand Java’s core features and to apply OOP principles in a practical scenario.
